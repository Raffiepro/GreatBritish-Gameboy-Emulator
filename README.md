# The Great British Emulator 🇬🇧 🇬🇧 🇬🇧 (Gameboy I guess...)
## GB-Emulator stands for GREAT BRITISH EMULATOR 🇬🇧!! Not to be mistaken with "GameBoy Emulator 🤮"
### God save our gracious King!
Long live our noble King!
God save the King!
Send him victorious,
Happy and glorious,
Long to reign over us,
God save the King.
Thy choicest gifts in store
On him be pleased to pour,
Long may he reign.
May he defend our laws,
And ever give us cause,
To sing with heart and voice,
God save the King.
